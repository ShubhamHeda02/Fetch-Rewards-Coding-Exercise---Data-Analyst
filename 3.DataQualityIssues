Here are some of the data quality issues that I found in the given dataset
1)There were lot of null values in the entire dataset.
2)There were 1726 duplicate values in the User file out of total 1980 values.
3)There were some barcodes which were in Receipt file but were not in Brand file leading to incomplete data.
4)The receipt json file was having a parent child relationship in it leading to creation of two tables leading to increase in complexity.
