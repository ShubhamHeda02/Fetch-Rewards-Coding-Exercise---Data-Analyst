Hello,
Hope you are doing great.
Although I have some data quality issues I first want to ask you what is the sourse of your data? and do you have data in any other format?
After carefully exploring your data I got to know that there are some issues with the data. The data is having lot of null values and there are abundant of duplicate
values in User table. I just want to know the reason for null values and duplication so that we can reslove the issue. The data quality is the major factor for the 
most accurate insights of the company. So we need to take care of those issues in order to get the best results.

Thank You
Shubham Heda
